# smoothScroll
A better version of zenScroll which doesn't break your other JS code. Basically event bubbling is kept.  That's it.

# example use

import smoothScroll from './smoothScroll' 

var defaultDuration = 600

var edgeOffset = 10

var sideBarDiv = document.getElementById("sideDiv")

var mainDiv = document.getElementsByClassName("nav") 

var scrollSlow = smoothScroll.createScroller(sideBarDiv, defaultDuration, edgeOffset)

var scrollFast = smoothScroll.createScroller(sideBarDiv, defaultDuration, edgeOffset)


No license, based on zenscroll, which also had no discernible license.  All original credit etc goes to them, anyone.  Have fun.
